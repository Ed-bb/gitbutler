# Demo File

This is a demonstration file created to show file reading and writing capabilities.

## Project Analysis

From reading your project files, I can see that:

### GitButler Overview
- **Purpose**: Git branch management tool for modern workflows
- **Tech Stack**: Tauri-based app with Svelte/TypeScript frontend and Rust backend
- **Key Feature**: Virtual branches that allow working on multiple branches simultaneously

### Current Issues Detected
- **Merge Conflict**: The file `apps/desktop/src/lib/state/tags.ts` contains unresolved Git merge conflicts
  - Lines 3-11 show conflict markers (`<<<<<<< ours`, `||||||| ancestor`, `=======`, `>>>>>>> theirs`)
  - There's a duplicate `Foobar = 'oohhh yeah'` entry that was added
  - Duplicate entries for `InitalEditListing` and `EditChangesSinceInitial` at the end

### File Details
- **README.md**: 142 lines of comprehensive project documentation
- **tags.ts**: 94 lines of TypeScript enum and utility functions for Redux state management

## Recommendations

1. **Resolve merge conflicts** in the tags.ts file
2. **Remove duplicate entries** in the ReduxTag enum
3. **Fix typo**: "InitalEditListing" should be "InitialEditListing"
4. **Clean up** the conflicted state before continuing development
